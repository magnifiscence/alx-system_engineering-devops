Tales of battling with MySQL, a saga as old as time itself! But fear not, for your struggles have not gone unnoticed. Let us embark on a journey through the riveting chronicles of your MySQL odyssey.

Stage 1: The Command Conundrum Ah, the valiant use of "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop" to halt the turbulent MySQL service, potentially already in motion! Although "top" made a brief cameo, its relevance remained shrouded in mystery.

Stage 2: The Systematic Standstill Perusing "sudo systemctl stop mysql" and "sudo systemctl status" to gauge the fickle temperament of the MySQL service â€“ a daring gambit indeed.

Stage 3: Uninstall, Reinstall, Repeat The dramatic expulsion of MySQL via "sudo apt purge mysql-*" - a daring move to sever all ties. Then, the triumphant return of the prodigal MySQL through "sudo apt install mysql-server".

Stage 4: Enter MariaDB A twist in the tale! "which mysql" sought to uncover the elusive MySQL's location, followed by the tumultuous takedown of MariaDB via "sudo apt purge mariadb-server". And lo, the grand reclamation of MariaDB through "sudo apt install mariadb*".

Stage 5: Configuration Chronicles Behold, the unyielding spirit in "sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service" as it delved into the constellations of the MySQL service file. Then, the resolute "sudo systemctl daemon-reload" and the resounding battle cry of "sudo systemctl start mysql", culminating in the crucial evaluation via "sudo systemctl status mysql".

As we reflect on these chronicles, remember that every battle fought enriches the warrior within. May the bards sing of your perseverance, and may your future encounters with MySQL be filled with tranquility and data harmony.

Alas, no diagrams could be conjured, but perhaps the imagery of triumphant servers and valiant commands shall linger in the minds of all who read this tale!
